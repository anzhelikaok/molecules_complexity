Molecular complexity prediction module

Since participants evaluated visual complexity for only a limited number of molecules, there is a need to develop an instrument that would allow researchers and practitioners to evaluate visual complexity of any uploaded molecule. In order to automatically determine the complexity of different molecules, a separate software module
